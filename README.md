## Features

### Question Types

Q-Quiz support three different question types multiple choice, number guess and map point guess. Each question type takes a question, a correct answer and additional configuration parameters like wrong answers or min and max values.
The questions types are implemented as ES6 classes and each follow the same structure.

## Architecture

### Frontend code

The frontend code gets transpiled to a jspm bundle and this bundle gets loaded and initialized by the jspm loader on client-side.

### Answer-Service

The frontend communicates with the answer-service to store all the entered answers, get the total score and statistics.
